  Hi everyone! My name is <span>Nody Risky Pratomo.</span> I live in Depok, West Java, Indonesia.
</p>
<p>
  When I was a kid, I am in love with computer and technology.
  My first computer was a Pentium 4 processor installed with Windows XP operating system.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, I have a passion for web development.
  I remember the first time I took an online-course about web development when I was studied in Junior High School.
  It was amazing because I could easily create and display any information on the website.
</p>
<p>
  Until I went to the college, I realized that a website is very useful and powerful in this digital era.
  We know that there is so many website we could access everyday and I am curious the technology behind it.
  Since my university didn't teach all the leasons about website, I need to explore more about it online.
</p>
<p>
  Right now, I work as a web developer in telecommunication industry.
  And I hope with my (future) skill about website, it could help my work and improve my carrer.
